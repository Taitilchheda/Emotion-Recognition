#Emotion Recognition

This project is aimed at developing an emotion recognition system using machine learning techniques. The model is trained to recognize emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, fear, and disgust.

Overview
Emotion recognition is an important task in various fields including human-computer interaction, psychology, and market research. This project utilizes machine learning algorithms to automatically detect and classify emotions from facial expressions.

Features
Utilizes deep learning techniques for facial feature extraction and emotion classification.
Pretrained models for face detection and emotion recognition.
Provides visualization of emotion recognition results.
Usage
Open the emotion_recognition.ipynb notebook.
Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to execute each cell.
Upload an image containing a face for emotion recognition.
View the predicted emotion label along with the probability distribution.
Visualize the detected face and predicted emotion using matplotlib.
Example
