This project is aimed at developing an emotion recognition system using machine learning techniques. The model is trained to recognize emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, fear, and disgust.

## Overview

Emotion recognition is an important task in various fields including human-computer interaction, psychology, and market research. This project utilizes machine learning algorithms to automatically detect and classify emotions from facial expressions.

## Features

- Utilizes deep learning techniques for facial feature extraction and emotion classification.
- Pretrained models for face detection and emotion recognition.
- Provides visualization of emotion recognition results.

## Usage

1. Open the `emotion_recognition.ipynb` notebook.
2. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to execute each cell.
3. Upload an image containing a face for emotion recognition.
4. View the predicted emotion label along with the probability distribution.
5. Visualize the detected face and predicted emotion using matplotlib.
